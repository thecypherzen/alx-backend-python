# Overview #

## Background Context ##
Python also allows asynchronous programming! Just as in JavaScript, python also defines async functions using async...await but unlike JS 
async functions that return Promises, Python's functions return `coroutines`. `Coroutines` and `Promises` both help us to access our results after the operations have been completed at a later time.

## Objectives ##
Understanding the following concepts is necessary to follow through and/or graps these code snippets:
    **Note that the codes are all organized in separate file/folders as necessary**
    - async and await syntax
    - How to execute an async program with asyncio
    - How to run concurrent coroutines
    - How to create asyncio tasks
    - How to use the random module </br>

| 1. | [0-basic_async_syntax.py](https://github.com/) | *The basics of async:* A coroutine that takes in an integer argument **max_delay**, with a default value of 10 named `wait_random` that waits for a random delay between 0 and **max_delay** (included and float value) seconds and eventually returns it. |
